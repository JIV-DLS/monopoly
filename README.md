## Synopsis

Our game is an American classic, Monopoly. The game is modeled after a real-life situation of buying and selling properties of different values and different characteristics in an attempt to be the winner, the one with all of the money at the end of the game. 

The message this simulation proves that while in your search to fortune you may have important decisions to make, a lot of what you are given is on a game of chance, and is completely, and undeniably random.
