## Synopsis

Our game is an American classic, Monopoly. The game is modeled after a real-life situation of buying and selling properties of different 
values and different characteristics in an attempt to be the winner, the one with all of the money at the end of the game. This is 
essentially achieved by aiming to establish a monopoly in a given zone (indicated by different colors) and then to profit off of having 
that property. This profit comes in the form of rent, which must be paid by the player who lands on an owned property of another player’s. 
Rent is more expensive in properties of higher value and rent also grows when there are more houses/hotels on that property.

Two die seal your fate, as the combination of the number on each dice is the amount of steps a player makes. The game also becomes more 
realistic as a jail, railroads, taxes, and utilities are added, as well as a series of “Chance” and “Community Chest” cards that can be 
drawn randomly to cause the player to assume either a positive or negative fate. Railroads, taxes, and utilities work almost the same as 
property, with minor differences in the way payment is made and to whom. The jail takes a player out of the game for three turns with a 
minor chance of getting out early. Seen to be an omen in the beginning of the game, jail is actually a good place to be near the end of 
the game. “Chance” and “Community Chest” cards range anywhere from paying up or receiving money to moving forward or moving backward on 
the board.

In the end, the message Monopoly is sending is clear, while in your search to fortune you may have important decisions to make, a 
lot of what you are given is on a game of chance, and is completely, and undeniably random.
